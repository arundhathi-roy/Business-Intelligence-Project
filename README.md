Puglia Winery Case Study

Introduction

Puglia Winery is a medium sized boutique winery located in Temecula, California, about 85 miles
southeast of Los Angeles. The wines produced are sold locally in California, interstate in the US
and internationally in the United Kingdom. They specialize in hot climate wines and produce three
varieties, pinot noir and merlot (red) and pinot grigio (white). Puglia Winery production and sales
have grown dramatically in the last 3 years, and the managing director, Jack Gillespie, believes
that any future growth needs to be better managed, and based on a better understanding of sales
trends. He has heard from vendors that data warehousing and business intelligence will provide
him with the capability to make more informed decisions. Your team has been hired as a consultant
to propose a data warehousing solution to Jack.
The operations of Puglia Winery include growing the grapes, producing the wine and selling it.
Currently there are 50 acres of the pinot noir, 50 acres of merlot and 35 acres of the pinot grigio.
Additional planting is possible but involves a long lead-time. Wine is produced by the winemaker,
Tommy Siragusa, who focuses particularly on quality. Puglia Winery wines can therefore be sold
at premium prices. Three types of pinot noir are bottled and sold under separate brand names. Two
types of pinot grigio, and two types of merlot are similarly produced. To increase production
volume, Tommy purchases additional high-quality grapes from surrounding vineyards. Stacie
Giano is the sales manager. A small amount of wine is sold directly through the cellar door, but
almost most all sales are to customers (wine merchants) in California, interstate and increasingly
to the United Kingdom. Sales to wine merchants are in cases of 12 bottles.
The winery has two separate information systems to help manage production and sales to wine
merchants. Information from these systems is difficult to aggregate as they have different data
formats and use different database management systems.

The Business Problems

Decisions about the growth of the business, in terms of the production volumes of the red and
white wine, which customers are important and which markets to focus on have been made by
Jack, with input from Stacie and Tommy. The decisions have been made based on experience and
“gut feel”. This has been effective previously but now that the business has grown, Jack wants
evidence based on data to better inform decisions concerning three important business problems,
about customers, products and markets.
